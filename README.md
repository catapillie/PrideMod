# Pride Mod

Pride Mod was almost entirely sprited by Lily and coded by catapillie, with additional spriting help from ReaverOfSouls and Stotch.

To use this mod, go into your mod settings and change the setting of each collectable or decal to the pride you want, then press F5 or Retry from the pause menu.

Note that this mod also integrates with CollabUtils2 by max480 to allow you to customise Silver Berries if you have it installed.

If you have any questions, would like to suggest a new pride, or need to report a bug or issue, join the [Pride Mod Discord](https://discord.gg/fPkfJdFdyq). 

You may also just send a direct message to Lilium#0864 on Discord for suggestions and catapillie#1927 for bugs.

If you want to use one of the flags in your own map, **do not depend on Pride Mod** - instead please DM Lilium#0864 on Discord for permission to directly use the files.
